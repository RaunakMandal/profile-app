# Profile App
## Description
This is the assignment for the Mobile App Development Intern role with Invest With Tribe.

## Problem Statement
Create a hybrid mobile application (use framework between ionic, React Native, expo - React Native). The application should support 1. Login by Google 2. After logging in the user can see his profile page which has his name and email.

## Solution Provided
The solution that I have provided is the bareminimum features as mentioned in the problem statement. I have used Firebase Google Auth for the Google Signin and used only a single page to display the changes.

## Possible Improvements
- Store the Logged in Data in Local Storage so that user do not have to login again and again.
- Create different pages for Signin, Profile, etc.
- UI could have been improved a lot, but I majorly focused on the functionality for now.

## Libraries Used
RN Google Signin - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-google-signin/google-signin
